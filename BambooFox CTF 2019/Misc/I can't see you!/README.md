## Writeup
I used [this website](https://www.lostmypass.com/file-types/rar/) to find the password of the rar file. The password is "blind". I also tried using `rar2John` to crack the password, but it was taking forever to find it.

After unzipping the rar file, there's a picture inside.

This is clearly Braille, find the conversion table online and get the flag.
