## Writeup
I searched "Master Rockstar" online and found that it's actually a programming language. There is a [website](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) that can run the lyrics and it outputs

114 114 114 111 99 107 110 114 110 48 49 49 51 114

Using the ASCII table these numbers translate to `rrrocknrn0113r`.

flag : picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
